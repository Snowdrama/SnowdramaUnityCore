# Snowdrama Unity Core
The core of some tools I use in a lot of projects. Some of the things in here are used in my other unity toolsets.

These packages were previously separated but in 2025 I moved them all into this one package.

# Requirements & Disclaimer
This was originally all built in the LTS version of 2019.3 was upgraded to 2022.3(current LTS version as of last edit) and I've used these most recently in version, Unity 6000.0.44f1 but I don't see any reason it shouldn't work in any version from 2019.3+

If they don't work in the future definitely drop an issue and I'll look into it! 

# Installation
* To install this package, use the Unity Package manager and click the + in the upper left.

* Then use the https git URL: https://github.com/Snowdrama/SnowdramaUnityTransitionTools.git
* That should be it, wait for it to install and refresh and you're good to go!

The goal is to be able for something to hold a reference to the options and be able to update them or read values easily.

### Transition Tools
A bunch of tools for doing managing and triggering scene transitions including scripts for hiding and showing the screen.
